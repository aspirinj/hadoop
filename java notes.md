### Properties
`Properties` class is a subclass of `Hashtable` and represents a persistent set of properties. The `Properties` are `key/value` pairs that can be saved to a stream or loaded from a stream. Each key and its corresponding value in the property list is a string. The `Properties` class offers you the capability to specify a default property that will be returned if no value is associated with a certain key.
